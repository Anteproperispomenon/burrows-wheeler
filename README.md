This is a simple layer over a simple BWT C library from 2008.

You can find the original C library in the openbwt directory.

## Warning

This was my first time using Haskell's FFI, so there may be
bugs in the code. It was also my first time using 
`unsafePerformIO`, so uh... I hope it doesn't mess stuff up
too much.
